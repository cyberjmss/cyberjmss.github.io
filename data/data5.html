                This graph shows the labour force status by sex and clearly shows that more men are employed compared to women. This is apparent across all categories except for part-time, where many more women work compared to men. More men are employed, especially full time jobs, whereas more women are unemployed. This difference is caused by women taking time out of their lives to look after the children and general family matters, whereas the men go out for work, pulling all the pay to keep the family under a roof. The data also reveals that women do more part-time work than men, which implies that they are working, but cannot work full-time due to other things they may be preoccupied with e.g. look after a childThis chart shows hours worked by age rise rapidly from the 15-19 age group to the 30-34 age then stagnate before dropping off starting at 60 years old. Males tend to work more than females for all age groups, except for the 25-29 year old group, where they are equal. This imbalance of male-to-female working hours could be explained by stereotypical roles in the family, with the husband typically being the breadwinner and therefore working longer hours. The wife takes care of the kids and house chores, leaving less time for work. The outlier age group of 25-29 could be caused by women just coming out of college, needing to repay debt just as much as men, and not having had kids yet to take away time from work. This data shows how social and cultural norms may cause women to work less relative to men their age, hampering their potential income and career development. It also highlights the importance of challenging these social norms to ensure equality for all.
