                This graph shows how common it is for different types of families to receive a certain weekly income. It is apparent that couple families with more children generally earn more than other families, because they need a lot more money to afford necessities for their children such as uniforms and textbooks, and other baby needs. However, single parent families seem to have a lower maximum income and are strapped with the amount of time they have, thus they are not able to work as many hours as other dual parent families. In the data, we also see that past the 2000 dollar range, both children and non-children family households have a proportionate population parity, however families without children are more likely to earn 600-1400 per week. These could be families that can't afford to have children, or young couples who don't need that much income to survive.This graph displays how family households earn significantly more than non-family households, with significantly more family households earning more than 650 dollars weekly and onwards. This is likely because non-family households typically only have one source of income, while family households benefit from multiple sources of income, like partners, children and parents contributing financially. Additionally, family households often have much higher expenses than non-family households as having children significantly increases their expenses like electricity, food and water, hence making it necessary to have a higher income for a family household to be sustainable.
