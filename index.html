    A visualization of census data</h1>
    <div class="intro">    
      <p>This website focuses on the subject of income and work, factors that influence incomes of individuals such as age, gender, and nationality, and how to bridge any disparities and eventually improve income equality for everyone in Australian society. By revealing the statistics on this and producing graphs and analysing this data, we aim to highlight current issues such as the gender pay gap, differences in pay based on one’s age and nationality, and how these can ultimately contribute to broader economic challenges. This project mainly utilises data from the 2021 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census on Income and Work, which has been gathered from around 21 million Australians. The goal of this project is to highlight the systemic issues contributing to income inequality, with a focus on providing insight to promote fair pay practices, reduce the gender and age pay gaps, and foster more equal opportunities in the workplace. Ultimately, our project’s aim is to inform policy decisions, business practices, and individual career choices in a way that helps address these ongoing disparities in the Australian workforce. The data sourced from the ABS reveals multiple income differences across various demographics, highlighting disparities between age groups, gender and nationalities. Understanding these differences is crucial to identify inequalities in income distribution and employment, between ages and genders. This data will help people to better understand the gender pay gap and its effects on the increasing poverty rates and economy as a whole. By making this data more digestible and understandable by the lay person we will be able to aid in the reduction and eventual dissolving of the gender and age pay gaps our current system creates. By analysing these patterns in income distribution, one can single out causes of inequality in wage distribution which would help to weed out unfair hiring and working practices. One of the crucial findings from the data is the gender pay gap, which remains a persistent issue in many industries despite efforts by society to counteract this. By analysing this data, we can gain valuable information on the causes behind wage discrepancies and determine whether they stem from differences in job types, hours worked, career progression opportunities, or systemic biases in hiring and pay practices. By producing valuable information on these issues and addressing them, we can guide efforts to promote fair pay and equal opportunities, helping people make informed career decisions while encouraging businesses and policymakers to implement changes that support income equality.
